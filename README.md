# SWATER
A smart water management for your home.

## What is Swater?
Swater is a smart water management system for your home, which uses data from several sensors to give you insights on your water usage, and lets you know when a water leak might be going on.

## How to set it up?
The main setup consists of two main parts: the sensors (and their circuits) and the web server.
This guide will explain how to set both of these up in a Windows machine.
